              Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by technology. As a kid, I dismantled old remotes trying to understand how a thin circuit
              board could control a TV. That curiosity grew into a passion for building things of my own.

              In middle school I discovered programming through <strong>Unity + C#</strong>, making 2D and 3D games for friends. By
              high school, I was diving deep into <strong>iOS development</strong> with Swift and Xcode. My first published app,
              <em>InsomniChat</em>, was built during sleepless nights sophomore yearâ€”teaching me backend basics and the grind of
              shipping to the App Store.

            <p>
              My interests expanded into <strong>web development</strong> with React.js, where I built sites for family and small
              businesses, and <strong>automation</strong> with Python to solve everyday problems. Software became my universal tool
              for creation and problem-solving.

              Today, Iâ€™m a <strong>Computer Science undergrad at Stony Brook University</strong>. My early tinkering gave me a head
              start, but my coursework and projects here sharpened my fundamentals in systems, algorithms, and security. Iâ€™ve
              also grown as a teammate, collaborator, and communicator. <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Check out the Education
